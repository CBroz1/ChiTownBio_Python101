# ChiTownBio presents Python 101

## Aims

This course is designed to introduce the basic of Python programming to a
Bioinformatics audience.

- [ChiTownBio](https://chitownbio.org/)
- [Censibal](https://censibal.com/)

## Terminology

### Languages

- **Command Line**: A text-based interface for interacting with a computer
  system, often `bash` on Unix-like systems, including Mac, and `cmd` or
  `powershell` on Windows.
- **Python**: A high-level programming language known for its readability and
  simplicity.
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
  syntax.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An document format that combines python and markdown
  code in a single document, via 'cells'.

### Tools

- **Repository**: A storage location for software packages, often hosted on
  platforms like GitHub.
- **Codespace**: An online development environment provided by GitHub, allowing
  users to write and run code directly in the browser, mimicking VS Code.
- **VS Code**: A popular editor and IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  for writing and debugging code.

## Course Structure

### Overview

After an initial setup, each session will consist of:

- **Bio Blurb**: A short presentation on a biology topic, and the broader
  scientific context.
- **Python Primer**: A brief introduction to a relevant Python concept.
- **Hands-on**: A practical coding challenge from the
  [Rosalind Project](https://rosalind.info/), where participants will work on
  exercises and/or personal projects.
- **Wrap-up**: A summary of the session, including key takeaways and
  additional resources.

Our goal is to provide a solid foundation in Python programming, enabling
participants to tackle bioinformatics challenges and projects with confidence.

## Getting Started

This course is designed to be run in a [GitHub
Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), which is an online
development environment. This allows you to run Python code directly in your
browser, without needing to install anything on your local machine. Every
GitHub user gets 60 free hours per month, well beyond what we will need for
this course, but you will need to remember to **stop your codespace** when you
are done with it.

1. **Sign up for a GitHub account**: If you don't already have one, go to
   [GitHub](github.com) and sign up for a free account.
1. **Create a Codespace**: Go to the
   [ChiTownBio Python 101 repository](https://github.com/CBroz1/ChiTownBio_Python101)
   and click on the green "Code" button. Select "Open with Codespaces" and then
   "New codespace". This will create a new codespace for you, which may take a
   few minutes to set up.
1. **Open the Codespace**: Once the codespace is created, it will open in a new
   tab. You will see a file explorer on the left side, and a terminal at the
   bottom. The file explorer shows the files in your codespace, and the
   terminal allows you to run commands.
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: In the file explorer, navigate to the
   `notebooks` folder and open the `00_Intro.ipynb` file. This is a Jupyter
   Notebook, which allows you to run Python code and write markdown in the same
   document.
